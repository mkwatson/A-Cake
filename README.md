# A-Cake
A VR birthday cake built using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

[See me here!](https://mkwatson.github.io/A-Cake/)

### TODO
* Build a room with solid walls
* Build a cake in Blender
* Add text? "Happy Birthday!"
* Figure out fire (particles? model in Blender?) (reset when they are all blown out)
* Make windows with "outside" images in the distance
* Make it so you can "poke" balloons with cursor (and correct physics)
